# Wau Factor Expo/Web ver

This project is entirely built on SDK53, and SDK54 is not workable at this stage as we have not updated the deprecated components to SDK54 workable components.
With that said, this project also does not work on Expo on apple devices, but web works fine.

This is a web app working prototype file for an interactive installation project named Wau factor.
It includes the feature of:
-communicating with server as a player client
-customizing individual Waus
-controlling individual Waus (gyro works on native apps, joystick works on both web and native)
-collision count showcase
